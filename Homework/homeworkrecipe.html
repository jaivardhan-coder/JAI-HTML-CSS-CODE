    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions ❓
    </h2>
    <hr>
<pre style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: medium;">
Can I freeze the cookie dough? ❄️
         Yes! You can freeze the dough for up to 3 months. Roll it into balls and freeze them on a baking sheet, then store them in a freezer bag.🧊🍪
How can I make the cookies thicker?🍪
      Chill the dough in the fridge for 30 minutes before baking. This helps the cookies hold their shape and prevents them from spreading too much.🧊🍪
What if I don't have brown sugar? 🍬
      You can substitute granulated sugar with 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of molasses to make your own brown sugar.🍬🧁
